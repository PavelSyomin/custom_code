## History

Custom Code is a fork of Flexi Custom Code module. It was originally created by AppsNity (the full copyright in source files was RBO Team > Project::: RumahBelanja.com & AppsNity.com). However, its support was dropped. At the point, original Flexi Custom Code can't be found in Joomla Extensions Directory, the developer's website is down, and the module receives no updates. In particular, it does not support Joomla 4 and breaks on PHP 8. This fork is almost a full rewrite of the original module, and only few lines of the old code are still present, and the options and name has also been changed. The main goal of the fork is to provide a simple and user-friendly custom code module for Joomla 3&4 with support for PHP 8.x and with a minimalistic set of options.
