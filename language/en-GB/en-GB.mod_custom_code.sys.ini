CUSTOM_CODE="This module allows you to insert any code like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP into site modules positions. For example, it can be used for an embed code, ads code, analytics code and other copy and paste codes. In fact, it's the same as a built-in Joomla's HTML module, but it does not strip anything from the code and also supports PHP."
